I would first differentiate each aura by setting a certain range for its energy, valence and danceability. Then by calculating the average energy, valence and danceability by checking whether these values fall under the ranges defined for the available auras we can find the two most suitable moods for the particular person.

Even though a certain song may have been entered in the top 100 songs it may not necessarily reflect that the person has a deep attachment to the song but it maybe the case that the person repeatedly played that song due to its popularity. Also if a person is engaging in repetitive tasks such as studying or going to the gym, the song selection might get skewed due to the higher amount of plays obtained during these sessions. A better way to calculate the aura would be to give priority to songs that regularly appear in the user's playlists and by investigating the genre of songs that the user listens to instead of focusing on individual songs.
